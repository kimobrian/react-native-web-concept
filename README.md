# Cross-platform-components concept

- Simple app to demonstrate that we can design, develop and prototype react-native components on web
  using react-native-web.
- This quick app depends on [this repo](https://github.com/KimoTek/cross-platform-components) which uses react-native-web, storybook and styled components to
  render a button for web and mobile both on a web interface.

## Isnstallation and Running

- Install deps with `yarn`
